                question: "How do cookies work?",
                answer: `Cookies are small text files that a website sends to your browser and are stored on your computer or device. When you visit the website again, your browser sends the cookie back to the website's server, allowing it to remember your preferences or login information.

For example, when you log in to a website, a cookie is usually created so that the website can remember that you are logged in as you navigate to different pages. Without cookies, you would need to log in again every time you visited a new page on the site.

Another example is when you visit an e-commerce website and add items to your shopping cart. The website uses cookies to keep track of your cart, so if you leave the site and come back later, your items will still be in the cart.

Overall, cookies allow websites to provide a more personalized and convenient experience for users. However, some users may choose to disable cookies for privacy or security reasons.`,

                question: "How do sessions work?",
                answer: `In web development, a session refers to a way to store information about a user across multiple pages or requests. When a user first visits a website, a session is typically created on the server side, and a unique session ID is generated and stored in a cookie on the user's browser.

As the user continues to interact with the website, the session ID is sent back to the server with each request, allowing the server to retrieve information about the user's session and personalize the user's experience. For example, a shopping website might use sessions to keep track of items in a user's shopping cart as they browse the site.

Sessions can also be used to implement user authentication and authorization. For example, a user might log in to a website and then be assigned a session that grants them access to certain parts of the site that are only available to authenticated users.

Overall, sessions are a powerful tool for building dynamic, personalized web applications that can remember user preferences and provide a seamless user experience across multiple pages or requests.`,
